         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To Preſerve the EAST-INDIA TRADE.</head>
            <p>IN ſuch ſort as to make it National truly for the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and ſo that the Landed Men of the Kingdom who are moſt burdened with Taxes, and are the only Perſons can and will ſuffer in their Rents and Eſtates, unleſs concerned ſome way in Intereſt by the now intended increaſe of this Mighty <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade may not be prejudiced, but rather much Advantaged thereby, and without paying down any thing for it.</p>
            <p>
               <label>It's Propoſed,</label>
            </p>
            <p>That this Trade ſhould be ſettled by Parliament, ſo as to be carried on by a Joynt Stock Excluſive to others, and under ſuch Regulations as ſhall be expreſs'd in the Act.</p>
            <p>That this Trade ſhould be Managed by a Number of Perſons (leſs then Fifteen enough) to be Choſen by Parliament to whom they ſhould be Accountable, and that upon Oath, when required.</p>
            <p>That that Number of Perſons ſhall (by a common Seal) be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to take up Money at Intereſt not exceeding 1400000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> for carrying on of this Trade at ſuch time and in ſuch proportions as ſhall by them be found needful for't.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:154303:2"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->
            <p>That the Money ſo taken up and Employed in this <hi>Trade,</hi> ſhall always be liable to pay Principal and Intereſt to the Lenders thereof as the ſame becomes due and be required. And,</p>
            <p>That there may be no fear of borrowing Money enough to thus carry on well this New intended <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, <hi>'tis farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there ſhould be ſettled for ever, one ſingle Months <hi>Tax</hi> in a year, after the rate of 70000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per Menſem</hi> as a Fund to a perpetual <hi>Intereſt</hi> at 5 <hi>per Cent</hi> of 1400000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> but not to be raiſed but when found needfull by the Perſons appointed to Manage the <hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that beſides the Money Employed in this Trade, and the Profit of it, out of which the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Money to be Borrowed for the carrying it on, may be eaſily paid, here will be Land Security as a perpetual Fund for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſettled, ſo that ſhould the <hi>Stock</hi> fail, the Lenders will be ſecure, which will give the Company ſuch a Credit, they can never want <hi>Money</hi> at the loweſt <hi>Intereſt</hi> that any where it can be had. And,</p>
            <p>Thus the Profits firſt ariſing, may go to clear the <hi>Money</hi> firſt Borrow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, and after that is paid, to the Owners of Land in Proportion to their Eſtates as Rated to this ſingle Months Tax; and to make this effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the whole Stock and its Proceed muſt for ever remain ſo fixed to the Land it ſelf, that it ſhall be in the power of no Man to ſell the one without ſelling the other at all, and it may be hence hoped, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt five or ſix years (without paying one Penny) the Landed Men of the Nation may have the whole Benefit of this great <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade. And,</p>
            <p>When any Dividend (after the Money borrowed to carry on the <hi>Trade</hi> is repay'd) ſhall be made of the Profits, it ought never to be under 15 <hi>per Cent,</hi> which (upon a Stock of 1400000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> to be kept always intire) amounts to 210000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> and that at the rate of 70000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per Menſem</hi> will be a juſt three Months Tax, which on ſuch Dividend (to yearly be hoped for) ſhould be paid to the Sheriff of the County, and by him be ſent to each Diviſion or Hundred of his County, and thence to each Pariſh, where the Owner of Land will receive as much Money as his Land would be aſſeſt at for a three Months Tax after the rate of 70000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per Menſem</hi> on every ſuch Dividend made. And this way of deviding will be very eaſie an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> ſafe. And,</p>

            <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->
            <p>This would make it National truly, and a great Advantage to all, and Landed Men only being therein concerned, and ſuch a Fund of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity ſettled, the Stock might at any time be eaſily enlarged (if found needful) for the Publick Advantage and Profit; ſo that 'twould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out-do all Companies that ever ſet up in <hi>England,</hi> be a general Good, and to be never complained of, which any other (on a Stock raiſed by Subſcriptions) will very ſoon be, and by eſpecially ſuch who may after have Money, they would gladly put into't, having not at the firſt ſubſcribed to it.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To this it may and will be objected and ſaid,</label>
            </p>
            <p>This is matter of Trade, and beſt managed by Merchants who know one another, and ſo are only able to chuſe fit Managers for it, whoſe Intereſt in a Stock (to be raiſed by Subſcriptions) will always oblige them to act the beſt they can for it; and Merchants being this way Excluded, where will you find able and honeſt Men to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, that will mind and manage the <hi>Trade</hi> to the beſt advantage, ſo well as ſuch Merchants would do that might have great Stocks themſelves in that Trade.</p>
